        <h4>Review</h4>
        A Silent Voice was an emotional roller coaster for me. To me it kind of opened a new point of view in my life. The fact that Shoya worked so hard for forgiveness gave me inspiration just from watching the movie. A Silent Voice was really different and there aren't many movies like it. It was truly spectactular. I reccomend this movie to you and everyone else.
